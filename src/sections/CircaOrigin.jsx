        Genie was not built for convenience — it was built to resolve the most persistent exclusion in the modern economy: Africa’s offline businesses.
        Born inside <span className="text-indigo-400 font-semibold">CIRCA RL</span>, a systems intelligence institution, Genie is the first product of a mission to solve problems that have endured unresolved for decades.

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">📐 The Mandate</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-400">
            CIRCA RL focuses on population-scale challenges that persist for decades and threaten systemic failure if left unsolved.
            Genie meets all three criteria: scale, duration, and terminality.

        <div>
          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">🔧 The Deployment</h3>
          <p className="text-gray-400">
            Deployed across Ghana and West Africa, Genie powers real-time commerce, transport, and services — all without legacy infrastructure.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-400">
            Genie is transitioning from CIRCA RL to e-qual — a sovereign operating entity with strategic independence, platform autonomy, and long-term mission fidelity.
